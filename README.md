# Find Your Hat 🎩

**Challenge Project** created as part of the Codecademy course to test skills in **JavaScript** and **Node.js**.

## Description 📖  
The goal of this project is to build an interactive terminal-based game where the player must find a hat (`^`) in a field (`░`) while avoiding falling into holes (`O`).  

### Game Rules:
- The player starts at the initial position (`*`) and can move up, down, left, or right.
- The objective is to reach the hat (`^`) without stepping out of bounds or falling into a hole (`O`).
- The field is randomly generated with obstacles and holes.

## Technologies 🛠️  
- **JavaScript**  
- **Node.js**

## How to Play 🎮
